Make a scores.json by:

1. Download sheets from this spreasheet as CSV: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At5eTj3CondTdFJqMVhpOTVVMUt4cXFKbEpLUEMtS2c
   Make your own if you like but keep the name of the Document and each sheet is important.

2. `coffee import.coffee ke` where ke is that country's TLD (We do include com when searching).

3. `coffee search.coffee ke >> scores.json`, now go back to 2 and do another country.
