Albania utilises both diesel fuel and hydropower to generate 
electricity, with the latter being more significant and having a greater
 potential.
Â&nbsp; 
Hydropower therefore provides the majority of the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s domestic 
power generation. Hydroelectricity is produced by three main power 
plants located in the north of the country: Koman (600 MW), Fierze (500 
MW) and Vau Dejes (250 MW). The 97 MW Vlora oil-fired power plant was 
commissioned in December 2009. 

Electricity production is almost entirely hydro-electric. In 2009 it 
accounted for 99.8% of production, with thermal (ex-oil) accounting

The total produced electricity in 2008 was 1,461 GWh. By source, oil 
contributed the largest portion (1,410 GWh), followed by hydro (46 GWh).
 The country imported 374 GWh of electricity, totalling in 1,835 GWh of 
domestic supply. The final consumption of electricity was 1,639 GWh, by 
the residential sector (742 GWh), commercial and public services (553 
GWh) and industry (344 GWh).Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp; Electricity generation in 
Cambodia is expected to face a significant increase in demand in the 
years to come. Electricity demand in Cambodia is forecast to grow from 
244MW and 946GWh in 2003 to 991MW and 3,478GWh in 2020. The supply 
requirements of Cambodia are projected to increase in average by 12.1% 
per year, and the peak load is expected to reach 991 MW in 2020.Â&nbsp; 


Electricity in Cambodia is one of the most expensive in the world. The 
total production cost for Phnom Penh can reach USD0.18 per kilowatt hour
 (kWh). Of this, USD0.12 represents the production costs while the 
remaining represents service costs. Even with government subsidy, 
electricity tariffs remain very high.Â&nbsp; Because of the lower costs 
of imported power and oil, electricity rates in 2009 were at least 
cheaper compared with the rates in 2008.

Accurate, up-to-date analysis of the use of biomass is scarce but its 
dominance in the energy balance is visible. In 2008, the renewable and 
waste source was from solid biomass, and the energy produced from solid 
biomass was consumed mostly by the residential sector. According to the 
FAO, wood fuel production fell just 11% between 1995 and 2002. 

The country possesses large hydropower reserves and some coal reserves. 
Offshore oil and gas reserves, which initially looked promising, were 
later found to be lying in complicated geological structures. Though 
expectations have been lowered considerably, production is scheduled to 
begin after 2010.</td>

Like most Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the republic of the 
Maldives has abundant renewable energy (RE) resources but its use is 
minimal beyond solar water heating in resort islands.Â&nbsp; The country
 depends overwhelmingly on petroleum imports for its electricity 
production. Firewood (e.g., dried branches) is also a main cooking fuel 
in most of the outer islands. Most urban households use LPG and kerosene
 for cooking. In the outer islands, the main source of energy for 
domestic purposes has been biomass. Nowadays, more outer island 
households are using kerosene and LPG for cooking instead of biomass 
materials (shrubs and coconut husks) .

The bulk of the fuel imports to the country are diesel fuel oil, which 
is mainly used for power generation, both by the state power utility 
(STELCO), and by close to 1,000 other electricity generators in the 
outer islands . This trend reflects the increased electrification of the
 islands, as well as the growth in tourist resorts. Due to the increased
 use of electricity and transportation, national energy consumption 
increased in the Maldives, from 223,970 tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 
2002, to 348,610 toe in 2008.Â&nbsp; 60% of all electricity produced in 
the country in produced and consumed in the resorts. Until recently, the
 State Electric Company (STELCO) supplied power to 32 main population 
centres of the Maldives. Power generation for MalÃ©, the capital, 
accounts for approximately 72% of all generated power for inhabited 
islands. Power demand in MalÃ© is expected to grow rapidly, at a rate of
 more than 11% per annum .Â&nbsp; 48.3% of the installed electricity

Over 90% of Burundi's energy requirements are met by the burning of 
wood, charcoal, or peat. Wood consumed mainly for cooking is, and will 
be for a long time, the main source of energy for rural 
households,Â&nbsp; while also remaining prominent in urban areas. The 
great majority of the population lives in rural areas and consumes 
primarily wood for fuel.

Most of the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s electricity supply is generated through seven 
hydroelectric plants, which have a combined installed power capacity of 
30.6 MW. Two of these hydro power plants deliver 85% of the domestic 
power supply: Rwegura (18 MW) and Mugere (8 MW). Burundiâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy 
supply therefore depends onÂ&nbsp; 95%Â&nbsp; hydro power.

Power utility REGIDESO also owns a 5.5 MW thermal power plant in 
Bujumbura, which has been mostly idle since its acquisition in 1995. Low
 electricity tariff levels and high diesel prices did not allow REGIDESO
 to finance fuel payments, and the plant has long been kept as an

hydropower plants and by increasingly relying on natural gas imports 
from Azerbaijan instead of from Russia. The construction on the 
Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas

energy production.

According to data from British Petroleumâ&#8364;&#8482;s 2009 Energy Statistical

Nigeria and Algeria in 2008.Â&nbsp; Angola had proven oil reserves of 
9.0 billion barrels (bbl) as of January 2008. Production was 1.875 mln 
barrels per day (bpd). This was up from 745,000 bpd in 1999. Domestic 
consumption is 64,000 bpd. 

Angola has a small natural gas production industry, which is used for 
the industry sector. Angola has 9.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of natural
 gas reserves as of January 1, 2008. With the considerable increases in 
proved natural gas reserves and government policies to end natural gas 
flaring, plans are under-way to convert much of the natural gas into

South Africa uses coal, its major indigenous energy resource, to 
generate most of its electricity and a significant proportion of its 
liquid fuels. Because of this, South Africa is the 14th highest emitter 
of greenhouse gases.

Energy contributes about 15% of South Africa's gross domestic product 
(GDP). Eskom is one of the world's 10 biggest electricity generators, 
and is in the top 11 in terms of sales. It generates around 95% of the 
electricity used in South Africa, as well as exporting power to other 
African countries. In addition to the functioning generation capacity, a
 number of previously-mothballed generating facilities are being 
re-commissioned, including a further 3,800 MW of coal-fired capacity. 

ESKOM operates South Africaâ&#8364;&#8482;s only nuclear power station, Koeberg 
(1,800 MW), two gas turbine generators (340 MW), six conventional 
hydroelectric plants (600 MW), and two hydroelectric pumped-storage 
stations (1,400 MW).

Electricity production was estimated at 258 TWh in 2008, mainly from 
thermal generation.Â&nbsp; Renewable energy currently only produces 
approximately 1% of the electricity generation.

South Africa had proven coal reserves of 48,000 million tonnes. They 
produce 283 million short tons of coal, while consuming 203 million 
short tons of coal. It exports approximately 28% of all coal mined.

As of January 1st 2008, South Africa had proved oil reserves of an 
estimated 15 billion barrels, and according to 2007 estimates produced 
approximately 199,100 bb/day and consumed approximately 505,000 bb/day.

Senegal relies heavily on wood fuel consumption which accounts for about
 90% of householdsâ&#8364;&#8482; energy needs. 
Â&nbsp;
Solar systems have been in use by SENELEC, the national utility, since 
1983, to provide for rural electrification. In some parts of Senegal 
solar energy production helps to increase the level of rural 
electrification from 6% to more than 25%. 

Due to modernisation deficits, the usable installed capacity in 2009 was
 reduced to 517.8 MW. RE does not play a significant role in 
grid-connected electricity supply. Total electricity generation in 2008

Electricity generation is entirely based on natural gas, heavy oil and 
hydro power â&#8364;&#8220; 90% of the capacity is based on fossil fuels. Firewood 
is used mainly for domestic consumption. The state company Azerenergy 
manages electricity generation across the country and operates eight 
thermal power plants (TPPs), six hydropower plants (HPPs) and seven 
module type power plants. Growth in power generation capacity has been 
flat since the increases in HPP capacity have usually been offset by 
decreases in TPP capacity. 

Government statistics suggest that the primary sources of energy are oil
 (79%), natural gas (15%) and electricity (6%). (It is unclear whether 
some element of double counting exists since between 80-90% of 
electricity is generated from natural gas.) Since 2004, the Government 
has made it a priority to invest the profits from the sale of oil and 
gas to exploit the onshore and offshore renewable energy (RE) potential.</td>

Its total primary energy supply in 2007 amounted to 28,048ktoe. Most of 
the demand for primary energy is satisfied by imports from the Russian 
Federation. Domestic energy sources - crude oil, biomass (mainly wood), 
peat, coal, natural gas, and hydropower â&#8364;&#8220; satisfy only 13% of demand. 
Crude oil and natural gas are the main energy sources. Fossil fuels,

constitute a significant part of the energy supply.

Belarus produces less than 10% of the crude oil it imports. About 90% of
 the refined petroleum products are exported. Belarus appears to be an 
important component of the Russian oil supply chain. Almost all natural 
gas is imported (99%).

Total electricity generation amounts to 29.92 billion kWh. The power 
generation plants are predominantly gas-fired and satisfy about 90% of 
domestic demand for electricity; the remainder is imported from Russia, 
Ukraine and Lithuania. Hydro energy accounts for only 0.1% of total

Mexico has a single nuclear power plant, the 1,400 MW nuclear reactor 
â&#8364;&#339;Laguna Verdeâ&#8364;&#157; which is operated by CFE. The general trend in 
thermal generation is a decline in petroleum-based fuels and a growth in
 natural gas and coal. Given that Mexico is a net importer of natural 
gas, higher levels of natural gas consumption (i.e. for power 
generation) are likely to depend upon higher imports from either the 
United States or via liquefied natural gas.
The national consumption of electricity reached 180.5 TWh in 2007. The 
residential sector took 45.83 TWh. The service sector demand rises to 
6.78 TWh/year, a value that is equal to 3.8% of the total electrical 
energy sales of the country.Â&nbsp; Industry is the main consumer and 
can be divided into large industries and medium-sized businesses. The 
latter are authorized to produce their electricity supply. Of the 
government installed power plants, 58.2% were thermal plants and 28.8% 
hydraulic.
In 2008 primary energy production was 10,522 PJ, oil-generated (89.9%), 
hydraulic energy (4.4%), biomass (3.3%) and coal (2.4%). Mexicoâ&#8364;&#8482;s 
primary energy structure is made up of coal, oil (crude and condensed), 
natural gas, nuclear energy, hydraulic, geothermic wind and biomass 
(bagasse of sugar cane, wood and forest waste). The main secondary 
energies are coke and the liquid gases from oil, gasoline, naphtha, 
kerosene, diesel, gasoil, dry gas and electricity.
The state company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) is the sole producer of 
the oil and gas resources largely found in the sea of the Gulf of Mexico
 and the coastal land areas adjacent to the Gulf. Only the deposits, 
where 68% of the known resources lie, are being exploited. Between 2000 
and 2004, the average annual oil production (crude, naphthas and 
condensed) was more than 3000 barrels a day. From 2005 onwards there was
 a slight reduction in crude oil production and in 2008 it was down to 
2793 barrels a day, an 8.3% drop on that recorded in the previous year. 
At the current rate of production the known reserves of crude oil will

in South America. Peru hopes to increase natural gas use in its economy 
and reduce reliance upon oil and fluctuating hydroelectricity. In 2010, 
the country produced 7.24 billion cu m and consumed 3.65 billion cu m of
 natural gas. The start-up of production at the Camisea project in 
August 2004 was the principle force behind this large increase, and the 
continued ramp-up of production there will likely cause Peruâ&#8364;&#8482;s natural

IPPs 20 GWh. The electricity generation by fuel source type was as 
follows:

The significant increase in electricity generated from the thermal power
 stations by 105 GWh in 2010 was to cater for growth in electricity of 
around 6.8% and the low water level at the Monasavu Hydropower Station.

In addition to the national utility's installed generation capacity, the
 Department of Energy (DoE) has also installed roughly 600 diesel based 
systems in various rural communities. 

According to the Reserve Bank of Fiji, the Fiji Electricity Authority 
(FEA) generated 587,004 MWh of electricity in the first three quarters 
of 2009.Â&nbsp; 

Currently, the contribution of the electricity sector to GDP is about 
3.6%. This is projected to increase as a result of greater access to 
electricity in rural areas under the Rural Electrification Programme 
which, apart from the extension of the grid networks and diesel schemes,
 also encourages the utilisation of solar home systems in rural

With 1.1 billion inhabitants in 2006, India is the second most populous

Bhutan, due to its rugged terrain, is endowed with a perennial flow of 
rivers, and rich vegetative cover of approximately 64.35 %. Bhutan is 
the only country in South Asia with surplus power generation capacity, 
and a hydropower sector that contributes 40% of government revenues, 45%
 of export earnings, and 25% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009. 
Given the potential of hydropower as a major export, and the potential 
of electrification to improve the living conditions of the rural 
population, the government has undertaken far-reaching institutional 
reforms to improve the investment climate for export-oriented hydropower
 projects, and to expand power distribution to largely rural domestic 
consumers in a financially sustainable manner.Â&nbsp; Today, Bhutan 
exports more than 75% of the hydroelectricity produced to neighbouring 
India. 

Renewable energy sources dominate the current energy supply in 
Bhutan.Â&nbsp; Firewood is the main source of primary energy and it 
represents the largest share of energy consumption.Â&nbsp; More than 60%
 of the population live in rural areas, where they have no access to 
modern forms of energy supply, and fuel wood is easily available from 
nearby forests.Â&nbsp; Bhutan is also endowed with vast hydropower 
potential from the perennially snow-fed north-south flowing rivers 
.Â&nbsp; 

Since 2007, hydropower generation has quadrupled to 1,489 MW and is 
further expected to increase to 1,602 MW by the end of the Tenth Plan 
and possibly reach 10,000 MW by 2020 .Â&nbsp; The total installed 
capacity of hydro power at present is 1488.66 MW. The domestic 
consumption is approximately 250 MW, and the rest is exported to India 
through a bilateral contract. Bhutan has 27 hydropower stations,

 10 micro-hydro plants.Â&nbsp; The total power generation increased from
 2,060 GWh in 2002 to 6,925 GWh in 2009, as a result of the

Russia has the worldâ&#8364;&#8482;s largest natural gas reserves, the second 
largest coal reserves and seventh largest oil reserves. It is the 
largest exporter of natural gas and since 2009 has periodically 
overtaken Saudi Arabia as the worldâ&#8364;&#8482;s largest oil producer. It 
currently supplies around 30% of the oil and 25% of the gas that the EU 
consumes, and is also a significant global force in the nuclear power 
industry.

Russia is, after the US, China and Japan, the worldâ&#8364;&#8482;s fourth largest 
electricity producer. The total electricity generation increased by 2% 
per annum in 1999â&#8364;&#8220;2009, reaching 1040 TWh in 2008.Â&nbsp; Russia is a 
net exporter of electric energy, but unlike in other energy commodities,
 electricity exports are not at all important for the system as a whole.
 The export volumes are tiny in relation to the total generation 
volumes. In 2008â&#8364;&#8220;2009, net exports were 17 TWh, constituting a meagre 
1.5% of the total generation.

Thermal generation accounts for a very high proportion of total 
electricity generation in Russia. Over 60% of electricity is generated 
in thermal power plants, with hydro-electric and nuclear power making up
 the rest.

The breakdown of electricity generation capacity between thermal, hydro 
and nuclear is close to the EU average, with a slightly smaller role for
 nuclear in Russia. The fuel mix in thermal generation is, however, 
different. In Russia, two thirds of the thermal power plants are 
gas-fired with the share of hard coal being less than one-third. 
Therefore, about 40% of the total electricity generation relies on 
natural gas, which makes the availability and domestic pricing of gas 
critically important for the power sector.

hydrology. This gives a reserve margin of 238 MW or 20% of demand. 
However during low hydrology, the reserve margin diminishes 
necessitating load shedding and procurement of expensive emergency 
power. The peak load is projected to grow to about 2,500MW by 2015 and 
15,000 MW by 2030. To meet this demand, the projected installed capacity
 should increase gradually to 19,169 MW by 2030.

A study conducted by the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) on the

Over 85% of the population rely on traditional fuels such as wood, 
charcoal, dung, and agricultural residues for cooking and heating.

    Firewood remains the predominant fuel for cooking. Nationally 68.3% 
of all households use firewood as their main sources of cooking fuel. 
Over 80% of households in the rural areas rely on firewood for cooking 
compared to 10 percent of urban households.
    Charcoal is the second most popular type of cooking fuel used by

Ethiopia relies heavily on a limited set of renewable energy resources 
to meet its requirements: principally biomass for thermal energy in the 
residential and commercial sector and large hydropower for electricity. 
It has yet to develop its other renewable and non-renewable resources in
 significant scale.

One of the defining characteristics of the energy sector in Ethiopia is 
its overwhelming dependence on biomass energy. Biomass energy, 
consisting of wood, charcoal and agricultural residues, provides 92% of 
the total final energy consumed. The main uses for biomass energy are 
for residential and commercial cooking. Biomass residues are also used 
in the sugar and tea industries. More recently, liquid bioenergy in the 
form of ethanol has started to be used as a gasoline (E10) in Addis 
Ababa. Per capita consumption of bioenergy in Ethiopia is about 1 tonne;
 annual consumption of biomass energy exceeds 80 million tonnes.</td>

Ghanaâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy sector is characterized by huge dominance of 
traditional biomass resources. In terms of endowment and utilization, 
biomass (mainly woodfuels â&#8364;&#8220; firewood and charcoal â&#8364;&#8220; and to a lesser 
extent crop residue) is the most important primary energy resource in 
Ghana accounting for an average of 81% of primary energy and 76% of 
final energy consumed between 2000 and 2008. Petroleum accounts for 12% 
of primary energy supply and 17% of final energy consumed, while the 
share of electricity in the national energy mix is assessed at between 
6% and 7% over the same period. However, the energy balance of Ghana is 
likely to be altered significantly following the discovery and 
commercial production of hydrocarbons since late 2010.

Rural households depend on wood (charcoal, firewood and crop/sawmill 
residue) for cooking, whilst about 60% of the urban households rely 
primarily on charcoal. Biomass resources cover about 20.8 million 
hectares of the 23.8 million hectare land mass of Ghana, and supplies 
about 60% of the total energy used in the country. The vast arable and 
degraded land inÂ&nbsp; Ghana has the potential for the cultivation of 
crops and plants that can be converted into a wide range of solid and 
liquid biofuels.

Electricity is produced from two main sources â&#8364;&#8220; hydro and thermal. 
Historically, Ghana has depended largely on hydroelectric power. Two 
hydroelectric plants, located at Akosombo (1,020 MW) and Kpong (160 MW) 
on the Volta River are responsible for up to 60% of installed generation
 capacity. The remaining 40% of installed capacity i.e. 831MW is 
produced from 5 thermal plants located at Aboadze, near Takoradi and 
Tema. However, thermal generation is projected to exceed hydro 
generation over the next decade with the majority of planned capacity 
additions expected to come from thermal sources. Peak electricity demand
 has been growing at a rate of 1.4% annually, from 1,258 MW in 2000 to 
1,547 MW in 2010; while total electricity consumption has been growing 
at an annual rate of 3.3% from 7,539 GWh to 10,305 GWh during the same 
period.

Electricity demand, which in 2010 was 1400MW, is growing at about 10% 
per annum. It is estimated that Ghana requires capacity additions of 
about 200MW to catch up with increasing demand in the medium to long 
term.

Electricity is also obtained from other sources, for instance solar 
energy, mainly in off-grid applications, is mostly used in the Northern 
part of Ghana, where the heat from the sun is intense.</td>

considerable.

Moldova has no reserves of coal and gas and only small domestic reserves
 of crude oil, which account for less than 0.1% of the total primary

Moldova features two non-minor power plants; CHP1 with 66 MW installed 
capacity and CHP2 with 240 MW installed capacity. In addition, CHPNord, 
NHE Costesti, and other domestic producers account for 136 MW.

Reliability of energy services equipment has improved recently so that 
the Nauru Utilities Authority (NUA) is almost capable of delivering a

approximately 43% of the energy generated.

There is limited use of LPG on Nauru, in particular in the domestic 
sector. Hotels and restaurants also use LPG for cooking purposes, though
 to a limited extent. This situation has arisen due to the long-term

â&#8364;&#732;Muela hydropower plant has a maximum nominal generating capacity of 
72 MW. However, in periods of national maximum demand, the generation 
capacity may be stretched (flat-out) to just over 80 MW. On the other 
hand, economic growth and increased access has meant that during peak 
times, especially in the winter months, demand can be as high as 120 MW.

Improving electricity access to the rural communities of Lesotho 
continues to be a major challenge. Even though Lesotho is a relatively 
small country (30,355 km2), with an estimated population of just over 2 
million, two-thirds of the country is sparsely inhabited, comprised of 
rugged mountains and deep valleys with small scattered villages on 
mountain sides. The majority of the population (76%) lives in rural 
areas, but has strong links to urban centres in both Lesotho and 
neighbouring South Africa. The majority of these villages lack 
electricity and the probability of connecting them to grid electricity 
in the foreseeable future is very low. Grid electricity, being a 
commercial form of energy, requires users to have a regular income. The 
income levels in rural areas are generally lower than those in urban 
areas due to higher unemployment and underemployment levels.

The daily average energy demands in these villages are generally low, 
varying between 0.5 and 1.5 kWh per household. Where electricity is 
available, it is used mainly for lighting, TV and radio. Alternative 
energy options are limited to kerosene or candles for lighting, and 
biomass fuels, often burned in inefficient stoves, for cooking and space
 heating.

Primary energy
Lesothoâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy balance is dominated by biomass energy resources, 
which is closely associated with environmental degradation in the form 
of deforestation and soil erosion, a phenomenon likely to continue until
 renewable energy technology becomes economically viable in the country.
 Energy comprises about 10% of Lesothoâ&#8364;&#8482;s gross domestic product, 
creating employment for about 0.1% of the population. Energy consumption
 has grown at the rate of about 9.0% per annum, which has exceeded the 
GDP growth rate of 2.1% over the same period. The countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s primary 
energy base consists of hydroelectricity, biomass, and petroleum 
products.

Most households generally use a combination of energy sources for 
cooking that can be categorised as; traditional (such as dung, 
agricultural residues and fuel wood), intermediate (such as coal and 
kerosene) or modern (such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and 
electricity). Electricity is mainly used for lighting and small 
appliances, rather than cooking, and represents a small share of total 
household consumption in energy terms.

areas, and their energy needs are primarily met by straw, jute stick, 
animal dung and firewood. Major proportions of the nation's firewood

Presently, known commercial energy resources include natural gas, oil, 
coal and hydroelectricity. Of the commercial fuels, natural gas is the 
most important, making up 70% of use, while imported oil, coal and 
hydropower comprises the balance. Among biomass fuels, agricultural 
residues contribute almost half, with cow dung, biogas and fuel wood 
making up the rest.Â&nbsp; In the past, peat was considered as a fuel

electricity is increasing day by day due to the growth of industry and 
population. To keep this in mind RES sources are coming forward. The 
off-grid solar PV systems have increased remarkably during the last few 
years. Now the capacity of solar PV electric systems in the country is 
25 MW .

The traditional energy sources (wood, charcoal and plant waste) are used
 extensively, especially in rural areas, but they do not appear in the 
national energy balance. Due to the over-consumption of firewood, 
approximately 30,000â&#8364;&#8220;50,000 ha of forests disappear every year. 
Morocco has more than 15% of the world reserves of oil shale. Currently,
 the exploitation of these deposits has not been undertaken due to

In 2008, the total electricity consumption in Morocco was approximately 
24 TWh. More than 80% of the electricity produced domestically is from 
coal, oil and gas. The remainder is produced from renewable energy

The exploitation of forest resources provides wood and by-products that 
meet most households' energy needs. In the rural villages, firewood and 
charcoal are still being used as a fuel source, and this traditional 
fuel impacts the forest and the health of residents.Â&nbsp; 

Power in the form of renewable energy by independent electricity 
producers has increased from 88MW in 2006 to 91MW in 2007. The increase 
is mainly due to the coming of several private operators such as Henri 
Fraise, HYDELEC, ENELEC, and EDM.

countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Morocco or Tunisia. The country does, 
however, have abundant energy resources. Given the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s small

Libyaâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy situation resembles that of the small oil-exporting 
Gulf countries more than that of its North African neighbours.
Electric power is produced from 30 power stations, which are largely 
oil-fuelled steam turbines, although there are a handful of gas-fired 
plants, and some turbines have been converted to gas to increase oil 
capacity available for export and other uses.  The peak load in 2006 was

Equatorial Guinea is the third-largest producer of crude oil in 
sub-Saharan Africa, after Nigeria and Angola. Foreign investment, 
primarily by U.S. companies, has been poured into the country's oil 
sector in recent years.Â&nbsp; Proven oil reserves are estimated at 1.1 
billion barrels. 

The Zafiro field is Equatorial Guinea's largest oil producer, with 
output rising from 7,000 bbl/d in 1996 to approximately 280,000 bbl/d by
 2004. Ceiba, the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s second major producing oil field, is 
estimated to contain 300 million barrels of oil. Reserves at 
Alba,Equatorial Guinea's third significant field, are estimated at 
almost 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Unlike the Zafiro or Ceiba 
fields, exploration and production at Alba has focused on natural gas, 
including condensates.

Natural gas reserves are located offshore, near Bioko Island, in the 
Alba and Zafiro fields. Natural gas and condensate production expanded 
rapidly in the 5-years following investments in the Alba gas field. The 
field contains 1.3 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of proven reserves, with 
probable reserves estimated 4.4 Tcf.

The gas-fired power plant in Punta Europa, the extension of which was 
finished in 2004, has four turbines that can generate 28 MW. An 
additional 4 MW of generation capacity has been built at the methanol 
complex on Bioko Island. The Riaba dam, which has been in operation 
since 1989, is another source of power on Bioko. The mainland region is 
supplied by thermal plants, which are connected to a network that works 
independently from the one on Bioko Island. The government started a 
major rehabilitation and expansion of the electricity grid in Bioko in 
2007 but few areas outside the main towns receive a regular supply of 
electricity. </td>

Currently, China is the worldâ&#8364;&#8482;s largest energy producer and 
second-largest energy consumer (after the United States). 

China is rich in energy resources, particularly coal. In 2008, it became
 the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world, an important 
factor in world energy markets. In 2009, China consumed an estimated 3.5
 billion short tons of coal, representing over 46% of the world total 
and a 180% increase since 2000. Coal consumption has been on the rise in
 China over the last decade. Coal production, also rising, was estimated
 at almost 3.4 billion short tons in 2009. China is also the 
fifth-largest producer and second largest consumer of oil. 

Whilst growth rates in Chinese renewable energy capacity are the highest
 in the world, its remains a small proportion of chinaÂ´s overall energy
 sector. From the end of 2005 to the end of 2007, renewable electricity 
capacity and generation increased by 30.6% and 20.6%, respectively, 
renewable electricityâ&#8364;&#8482;s share of total capacity decreased by 1.37%, 
and its share of electricity generation decreased by 1.23%. This 
decrease was due mainly to the fact that hydroelectricity development 
was much slower than traditional fossil fuel electricity generation. 
This suggests that in spite of the rapid development of renewable power,
 Chinaâ&#8364;&#8482;s electricity generation still relies heavily on fossil fuel. 
Without significant changes, this trend is likely to continue and carbon
 emissions will continue to grow. In 2009, net generation was 3,446 
Bkwh, 82% of which came from conventional thermal sources. Installed 
capacity increased over 10% between 2007 and 2008 and is expected to 
grow in the next decade to meet rising demand particularly from demand 
canters in the East and South of the country. Furthermore, China added 
an estimated 29 GW of grid-connected renewable capacity, for a total of 
263 GW, an increase of 12% compared with 2009. Renewable accounted for 
about 26% of Chinaâ&#8364;&#8482;s total installed electric capacity, 18% of 
generation, and more than 9% of final energy consumption in 2010. China 
now leads in several indicators of market growth: in 2010, it was the 
top installer of wind turbines and solar thermal systems ad was the top 
hydropower producer.Â&nbsp; 

China is also actively promoting nuclear power as a clean and efficient 
source of electricity generation. Although nuclear capacity (around 9 
GW) makes up only a small fraction of Chinaâ&#8364;&#8482;s installed generating 
capacity, many of the major developments taking place in the Chinese 
electricity sector recently involve nuclear power. Chinaâ&#8364;&#8482;s government 
forecasts that over 70 GW will be added by 2020.

In 2008, the total primary energy production reached 2600 million tonnes
 of coal equivalent (Mtce), or 1820 Mtoe. Of that total, coal accounted 
for 76.6%, oil for 10.4% and natural gas for 3.9%, while hydropower, 
nuclear power and others contributed 9.0%. China has become the world 
leader in renewable energy, now at 8% of total primary energy.

energy supply increased at an annual average rate of 7.33%, far 
exceeding the economic growth rate of 6.2% for the same period. 
Likewise, per capita primary energy supply grew from 1.0 tonne of oil 
equivalent in 1980 to 4.76 tonnes of oil equivalent in 2009. The level 
of increase was similar to that of Japan and of most European economies.

Renewable energy represented 2.7%of the domestic energy use in 2008. The
 Korean Government wants to increase this to 11% by 2030.
Oil supply in 2009 was 93.3 Mtoe, a 1.21% increase from the previous

Middle East. Coal supply in 2009 totalled 64.7 Mtoe, a 3.83% increase 
from the previous year. This substantial increase was the result of a 
strong demand from the power sector for coal, due to its cost 
competitiveness compared to other fuels.

 small wood, coal, kerosene supplies for basic cooking and heat. 
However, the most common fossil fuel energy sources are kerosene, fuel 
wood and crop residue. About 75% of rural energy supplies are derived

Brazil produces enough energy to cover 80% of its demand. Brazil is the 
largest consumer of energy in South America. 

Brazil has vast hydro-electric resources and accounts for more than 60 
hydro-electric facilities with installed capacities of at least 100 MW. 
Twenty-three of these facilities have installed capacities greater than 
1,000 MW. Together with Paraguay Brazil operates by some measures the 
worldâ&#8364;&#8482;s largest hydro-electricity complex, the ItaipÃº facility on the
 ParanÃ¡ River, with a capacity of 13,600 MW. The remaining electricity 
generated in Brazil comes mostly from coal and gas-fired thermoelectric 
plants. In recent years, Brazil has run an overall power surplus, 
allowing exports to its neighbours.

In 2010, Brazil produced 2.7 million barrels per day (bbl/d), of which 
75 percent was crude oil According to theÂ&nbsp;Oil and Gas Journal 
(OGJ), Brazil has 14 billion barrels of proven oil reserves in 2012, the
 second-largest in South America after Venezuela. PetrobrasÂ´s discovery
 of large offshore Campos and Santos Basin oil fields in 2007, 
containing five to eight billion barrels of oil expanded the countryÂ´s 
proven reserves by 40-50%.
Brazil has also discovered enormous â&#8364;&#339;pre-saltâ&#8364;&#157; oil fields, around 
18,000 feet below the ocean bed, under a thick layer of salt. Brazil's 
pre-salt announcements immediately transformed the nature and focus of 
Brazil's oil sector, and the potential impact of the discoveries upon 
world oil markets is vast. Some analysts estimate there is more than 50 
billion barrels of oil equivalent located in these reserves. However, 
considerable challenges must still be overcome in order to bring these 
reserves to fruition. The difficulty of accessing reserves, considering 
both the large depths and pressures involved with pre-salt oil 
production, represent technical hurdles that must be overcome.

Brazil has the largest coal reserves in Central and South America, the 
proved recoverable reserves are around 10 billion tons. In 2006 Brazil 
produced 7 million tons of coal, while coal consumption reached 23.8 
million tons.Â&nbsp; Almost all of Brazilâ&#8364;&#8482;s coal output is steam coal,
 of which about 85% is fired in power stations.

Brazil holds the sixth largest uranium reserves in the world. Brazil has
 two nuclear power plants, the 630-megawatt (MW) Angra-1 and the 
1,350-MW Angra-2. State-owned Eletronuclear, a subsidiary of Eletrobras,
 operates both plants.</td>

 ninth largest energy producer, accounting for around 2.4% of world 
energy production. In 2008-2009, Australiaâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy production was 
17,769 petajoules and net energy exports accounted for 68% of domestic 
energy production. It is one of only three net energy exporting nations 
in the OECD. 

The main fuels produced in Australia are coal, uranium and natural gas. 
Australian resources of uranium account for 47% of total world resources
 while Australian coal resources make up 10% of the world total. 

In 2008-2009, Australiaâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy production was dominated by coal, 
which accounted for 54% of the total energy production in energy content
 terms, followed by uranium with a share of 27% and natural gas with a 
share of 11%. Crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) represented 6%
 of total energy production, and renewable represented 2%. 

Australia was the worldâ&#8364;&#8482;s largest coal exporter and, according to 
Cedigaz, the fourth largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 
2010, after Qatar, Indonesia, and Malaysia. It is a
net importer of crude oil and refined petroleum products, but a net 
exporter of liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG). Hydrocarbon exports accounted for 34% of total commodity 
export revenues in
its fiscal year 2009-2010. Natural gas production in Australia reached 
1.6 Tcf in 2010 and could triple by 2020. About half of natural gas 
production is converted into LNG for export and the other half is 
consumed domestically.

Australia accounts for around 6% of world black coal production and is 
the fourth largest producer after China, the United States and India. 
Australian coking and steaming coals are high in energy content, and are
 low in sulphur, ash and other contaminants. Around 87% of Australiaâ&#8364;&#8482;s
 black coal production is destined for export. Coal is Australiaâ&#8364;&#8482;s 
largest commodity export, earning AUD 44 billion in 2010â&#8364;&#8220;11. It is 
also an important component of domestic energy supplies, accounting for 
around 75% of fuel used in electricity generation. Australian coal 
production has been increasing in the last decade, underpinned by strong
 growth in demand and the addition of new capacity. 

In 2008-2009, around 261 terawatt hours of electricity (including 
off-grid electricity) was generated, mostly from thermal sources. Coal 
accounted for 77% of total electricity generation, followed by natural 
gas (15%), hydro (4.7%), wind (1.5%), biomass, biogas and solar (1.2%) 
and oil (1.0%). Coal is the major source and expected to remain so, 
reflecting its wide availability and relatively low cost. However, given
 the number of gas-fired, Coal-Seam Methane-(CSM)-fired and wind 
projects under development, those sources are expected to account for an
 increasing proportion of total electricity generation.

Energy contributes greatly to Viet Namâ&#8364;&#8482;s economic development, 
supporting industrial growth and generating foreign revenue from 
exports. Viet Nam is relatively rich in diverse fossil energy resources,
 such as oil, gas and coal, as well as renewable energy such as hydro, 
biomass, solar and geothermal. In 2009 Viet Namâ&#8364;&#8482;s proven energy 
reserves consisted of 615 million tonnes (Mt) of oil, 600 billion cubic 
metres (bcm) of gas, 5883 Mt of coal, and a hydropower potential of 
20,000 MW. Natural gas and crude oil are found mainly offshore in the 
southern region, while coal reserves (mainly anthracite) are in the 
northern region. Since 1990, Viet Nam has become a net energy exporter; 
its main energy exports are crude oil and coal.

Vietnamâ&#8364;&#8482;s coal production increased steadily from 4.6 Mt in 1990 to 
39.8 Mt in 2007, matched by the growth in exports and domestic demand. 
In 2007, the country exported 22.2 Mt of coal, a record amount. Nearly 
56% of coal production in 2007 was exported to China, Japan, Korea, 
Chinese Taipei, Thailand, France and other economies. Primary coal 
supply increased by 12% per year from 2000 to 2007, from 4,372 ktoe to 
9,681 ktoe, before a 21.5% rise to 11,767 ktoe in 2008. In 2007, coal 
used for power generation accounted for 14% of total coal consumption. 
Viet Namâ&#8364;&#8482;s gas reserves are more promising than its oil reserves. In 
2005, the latest year for which figures are available, proven gas 
reserves were estimated at 600 bcm, although that figure is likely to 
increase as more oil and gas are discovered. Gas resources are found in 
many parts of Viet Nam, but large gas reserves are almost all found in 
offshore basins.

Electricity generation increased at an average annual rate of 13% 
between 2000 and 2009, from 26,562 GWh in 2000 to 83,161 GWh in 
2009.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp; 

Low-income households in rural areas rely primarily on biomass, which 
consists of wood and agricultural waste, for cooking. In Vietnam,

The annual growth of primary energy supply increased from 3.17% to 4.3% 
during 1997-98 to 2006-07. 

Indigenous natural gas is the largest source of energy supply in 
Pakistan contributing 27.7 million TOEs (45.4%) in 2009/10, followed by 
oil products, mainly imports, at 21.3 million TOEs (34.9%), 
hydro-electric power at 7.5 million TOEs (12.3%), coal, mainly imports, 
at 3.7 million TOEs (6.1%) and nuclear power at 0.8 million TOEs (1.3%).
 Consumption of indigenous natural gas has grown rapidly in all sectors 
of the economy (residential, commercial, industrial, transport and 
power) over the past 15 years, driven by growing availability of gas and
 a low, government-controlled gas price as compared with alternate fuel 
prices. As a result, Pakistan has developed a vast natural gas 
transmission and distribution network across the country .Â&nbsp; 

Electricity is used for domestic, commercial, agriculture and industrial
 purposes. Despite its high per unit price, household demand for 
electricity is growing. This sector is the largest consumer of 
electricity in the Pakistan with a share of 42%, whereas the industrial 
and agriculture sectors shares are 25.2% and 13.3% respectively. 

In 2008, the total generation capacity from the Water and Power 
Development AuthorityÂ´s (WAPDA) own hydro and thermal sources plus 
generation from two nuclear power plants, KESC and IPPs stood at 19,420

Nepalâ&#8364;&#8482;s economic and social development is being hampered by its 
inadequate energy supply. The country does not have its own reserves of 
gas, coal or oil. Although its most significant energy resource is 
water, less than 1% of the potential 83,000 MW of hydropower is 
currently harnessed. Firewood is the predominant energy carrier, 
constituting more than 70% of consumption. However, its use is 
inefficient, and poses a threat to the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s forests. At the same 
time, the indoor pollution caused by open hearths in homes presents a 
hazard to health. Electricity is generally only available in urban areas
 .

Biomass is the major source of energy, particularly in rural Nepal. 
Biomass fuels consist of both woody and non-woody biomass. The former 
come from trees and shrubs, the latter from crop residues and other 
vegetation. Fuelwood from forest and tree resources, charcoal mainly 
from woody biomass, residues from different agricultural crops and 
animal dung are the major biomass-based energy resources .Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;
 Coal, petroleum products and electricity are the commercial sources of 
energy that are utilised in Nepal. However, the country spends a huge 
amount of its foreign exchange reserves for the importation of fossil 
fuel. In addition, transportation problems arising from the geographical
 structure of the country tend to bar people living in remote areas from
 using petroleum products .

The Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), the government-linked monopoly 
electricity supplier, serves only 15% of the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s total 
population. For this small fraction of customers, reliable electricity 
access is less than 8 h per day, with rotational blackouts accounting 
for the remaining 16 h. In December 2008 the Nepal Government declared a
 â&#8364;&#339;national energy crisisâ&#8364;&#157; and one year later the World Bank argued 
that â&#8364;&#339;Nepal is experiencing an energy crisis of unprecedented 
severity, caused by years of under-investment and sharp growth in 
electricity demandâ&#8364;&#157;. Nepal ranks among the lowest in the world in 
terms of net electricity generated per capita and energy intensity; and 
two-thirds of households live at least a 5-18 days walk from the nearest
 village connected to the electricity grid . 

The annual electricity generation on the grid system in 2009-2010 was 
about 3,690 GWh, of which about 57% was generated by power plants owned 
by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), 26% by IPPs, and the remaining

Electricity generation grew from 16.8 GWh in 1997 to 29.3 GWh in 2007, 
an average growth rate of 5.8%. Electricity generation in 2009 was 
estimated at 31 million kWh; and electricity consumption in 2008 was 
estimated at 29.76 million kWh. Zero growth was experienced in 2005 
resulting from an economic slowdown in the wake of a destructive

of available power, which is often not produced in full.

At present, energy production is estimated at 2.69 TWh, with net imports
 of 10.01 TWh and electricity consumption of 3.22 TWh. Peak demand in 
2008 was approximately 500 MW. About 60% of the population resides in 
the north of Namibia where electrification rates are very low. A strong 
majority of the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s rural population, roughly 80%, relies on 
wood fuel.

Currently, electricity is generated by three main power stations relying
 on coal, diesel, and hydropower. Furthermore, the country relies 
heavily on energy imports from Zambia and South Africa. The hydro 
powered Ruacana station in northern Namibia generates the most power, 
approximately 240MW, for distribution to the entire country except the 
north-eastern Caprivi region. Van Eck power station, outside of 
Windhoek, operates on coal power and generates roughly 120 MW of power. 
The Paratus station on the western coast of Namibia is used mostly as a 
standby station for the coastal area with four diesel powered generators
 producing at maximum 6.4 MW of power each. 

Namibiaâ&#8364;&#8482;s main transmission line extends directly into South Africa to
 several of its power stations. The Katima Mulilo coal station in the 
easternmost portion of the Caprivi region is operated with coal imported
 from Zambia. The station is also connected to a hydro power station

its power. These outside power sources, which Namibia has to rely on, 
are offered through its membership in the association of Southern 
African Power Pool (SAPP).

The Republic of Macedonia is very poor in primary energy 
resources.Â&nbsp; There are two major open pit coal mines that supply 
two thermal power plants (TPPs) (TPP Bitola and TPP Oslomej), and two 
smaller open pit mines that produce lignite for the industry and other 
sectors. The coal deposits of the mines adjacent to the power plants are
 of very low heat value (lignite). Their capacities are limited and the 
plants are due for retirement in about 10 years.

Macedonia has very limited hydro potential. Electricity production 
potential from the existing and future hydro power plants (HPPs) is 
estimated at 6500 GWh/year. Average annual production from the existing 
HPPs is approximately 1200 GWh/year with installed capacity of 540 MW.

Due to some unresolved ownership issues, the gas transmission network 
has not been extended with an appropriate distribution network. 
Currently, only a handful of industrial facilities and the district 
heating company in Skopje use natural gas. Over the past 10 years the 
annual utilization of the pipeline has been between 8 and 12%.

Wood is used mostly for space heating, and only a limited number of 
industrial facilities use wood waste as a fuel substitute. The use of 
geothermal water (with a relatively low temperature) is limited to 
district heating in a small city in the eastern part of the country, and
 for space heating of greenhouses in the agricultural sector.

Benin has several crude oil reserves that are officially subdivided into
 17 blocks. Seven blocks have already been granted to companies who are 
currently actively exploring existing resources. From 1982 to 1998, 
Benin has exploited a small offshore oil field. The cumulated production
 is an estimated 22 million barrels of crude oil. Potential reserves are
 assessed at more than 5 billion barrels of crude oil, and more than 91 
billion mÂ³ of natural gas. Therefore, several multinational oil 
companies are investigating sites of local reserves and their 
availability.

As with many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Benin's energy sector is 
dominated by the use of biomass-based energy sources. Households are 
responsible for the majority of the total energy consumption, with a 
total of approximately 63.9% in 2011. The transport sector accounts for 
23.2%, the service sector for 10.6%, and the industry sector for about 
2.3% in the same year.

Beninâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy is produced by CEB (CommunautÃ© Electrique du Benin), a
 binational company owned by Benin and Togo. Energy is then distributed 
by SBEE (Societe BÃ©ninese d'Energie Electrique). Between 2005 and 2007,
 CEBâ&#8364;&#8482;s energy production declined, and available imports from CÃ´te

interrupted by drought, SBEE imports electricity directly from 
neighbouring countries such as Ghana and CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and engages in

The DRC produces a modest amount of coal, and a very limited amount of 
natural gas. Hydropower resources are abundant. The main sources of 
hydroelectricity are the 2 Inga dams, 140 miles south-west of Kinshasa, 
the capital. 

Despite having the potential to generate an estimated 40,000-45,000 MW 
per year just in hydroelectric power, estimated available capacity was 
1,170 MW in 2008. Total electricity generation in 2009 was 7,830 GWh, 
almost entirely from hydroelectric sources.</td>

The generation capacity of Liberia primarily consists of the Emergency 
Power Program (EPP), created in 2006 to re-establish electricity 
services in the capital, Monrovia. 9.6 MW has been installed as of 2010.
 The remainder of Liberia's generation capacity is in the form of 
independent diesel generators, estimated to have a capacity of 15 MW. 
The majority of commercial enterprises and institutions generate their 
own power.
The current energy situation in Liberia is characterised by a dominance 
of traditional biomass consumption and low access to poor quality and 
relatively expensive electricity. This is  due to the underdeveloped 
economy whose infrastructure was extensively destroyed during the 14 
years of civil crisis
As in many Sub-Saharan African countries, woody biomass is the primary 
energy source for domestic cooking and heating. In 2004, it was 
estimated that over 95% of the population relied on firewood, charcoal, 
and palm oil for their energy needs. Electricity and petroleum products 
are mainly used for industry and transportation. Kerosene, electricity, 
and liquefied petroleum gas are used for  lighting, cooking, and 
entertainment by higher income households in urban areas.
Before the civil crisis, the total installed electricity generation 
capacity, including the private sector, was about 412 MW.</td>

The ElectricitÃ© Nationale de GuinÃ©e (EDG, National Electricity Company

thermal and hydropower contribute 45% and 55% respectively. The main 
thermal and hydro plants are Tombo and Garafiri with 115MW and 75MW of 
installed capacity. Given the lack of maintenance, repairs and spare 
parts, however, only about half of the installed capacity is currently 
operational.

Investment in the power sector is essential because demand is set to 
rise sharply as mining investment and wider economic growth pick up. 
Energy ministry projections show mining sector demand alone rising from 
some 80MW in 2010 to more than 500MW by 2015 and 600MW by 2020, when 
domestic demand is projected to reach 1,100MW.

The potential for becoming a regional power supplier is unlikely to be 
realised in a country where the biggest hydropower producer, the 
French-built Garafiri dam, is operating at well below its 75MW capacity.
 Electricity supply across the country is below 100MW, and generation 
can be as low as 30MW, leading the Government to bring in expensive 
emergency solutions. Outside Conakry, pre-independence micro hydropower 
dams continue to supply power only because of the resourcefulness of 
Guinean engineers and technicians.

Electricity demand is increasing at about 7% annually and is expected to
 continue to grow at this rate for the foreseeable future. Egyptâ&#8364;&#8482;s 
peak electricity demand reached 21,330 MW for the fiscal year 2008/2009 
(fiscal year June-July). Energy is also essential for Egyptâ&#8364;&#8482;s economic
 growth for two primary reasons: it is a direct driver of domestic 
development, and represents a source of foreign currency associated with
 fuel exports.

With respect to renewable sources, approximately 11.2% of Egyptâ&#8364;&#8482;s 
power comes from hydropower facilities. When the Aswan Dam was developed
 in the 1960s, it met the vast majority of Egyptâ&#8364;&#8482;s electricity demand.
 Hydro-electricity still represented 50% of Egyptâ&#8364;&#8482;s capacity in 1980, 
but, due to major increases in demand, had fallen to less than 15% in 
2006. Hydro capacity has been constant at 2842 MW since 2007/08. The 
Aswan Dam, was constructed to control the Nile water discharge for 
irrigation. In 1967, the 2.1 GW High Dam hydropower plant was 
commissioned, followed by the commissioning of the Aswan 2 power plant 
in 1985, the commissioning of the Isna hydropower plant in 1993 and that
 of Naga- Hamadi in 2008. Power generation from gasification of sewage 
sludge in waste water treatment plants is already being used (for 
example, the El-Gabal El-Asfer 23 MW plant), with a potential generation

Many thermal power plants (TPPs) are outdated, are not fitted with 
environmental control equipment and lack spare parts. There exists 
significant hydropower potential but this has not been exploited because
 of lack of investment and antiquated equipment. In recent years, the 
construction of new hydroelectric power plants (HPPs) has been 
announced, presumably using domestically-built turbines and generators. 
Some of these are relatively large (50-100 MW) but insufficient in 
output to make much of a dent in unmet demand. The output from these 
plants is likely to satisfy demand in those areas in which they are 
located. The Huichon Hydropower Station, which is under construction, is
 the largest such facility to be built in 20 years. 

The DPRK holds abundant coal reserves. According to the EIA, it was the 
19th largest producer and 22nd largest consumer of coal in the world in 
2006. Coal production is hindered by the obsolete equipment, high 
accident rates, equipment failure and inadequate transportation 
networks. A key development in this sector has been the significant 
export of coal to China - ranging from 2.8 to 3.7 million tonnes per 
year from 2005 through 2009. Chinese firms have invested in the 
infrastructure to extract and export coal and other minerals though the 
impact of these investments on energy efficiency in the DPRK itself 
appears small.

Since 2000 there have been modest improvements in the energy sector, 
which have been underwritten primarily by Chinese investment. There are

has steadily increased over the last years while consumption intensity 
remained the same. In 2007, a total of about 5 million toe of primary 
energy was consumed in Mongolia. With approximately 2 toe, the average 
consumption per capita is still relatively low, yet equals one fifth of 
the German average. The main primary energy resource is coal with a 
share varying between 83 and 87 %. Mongolia is a coal exporting country,
 mainly to China. 

Although exact figures are not available, the contribution of RE 
resources to the countryâ&#8364;&#8482;s primary energy supply can be considered as
